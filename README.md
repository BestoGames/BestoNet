ISD Rollback is a custom rollback networking solution developed for the fighting game [Idol Showdown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1742020/Idol_Showdown/). Built in C# for Unity, it integrates with Facepunch Steamworks to provide a robust and efficient rollback implementation.

## Background

We developed ISD Rollback to replace our initial Unity GGPO implementation, which faced several challenges:
- Unplayable connections at long distances (experiencing ~7 frames of rollback)
- Maintenance difficulties due to GGPO's C++ codebase
- System instability during poor network conditions

## Core Features

### Advanced Rollback Management
- **Speculative Frame Saving**: Optimizes memory usage by selectively saving frames during rollback
    - Currently saves the midpoint frame, confirm frame, and end frame
- **Input Prediction**: Repeats last received input to avoid unnecessary rollbacks when predictions are correct
- **Rift Management**: Configurable options for handling one-sided rollback scenarios
- **Reliable Input Messaging**: Maintains a 7-frame input buffer to handle packet loss and out-of-order delivery

## Implementation Requirements

### Essential Components
1. **Frame Timing System**
    - Requires precise frame length control
    - Current implementation uses a separate thread for accurate timing

2. **State Management**
    - Save/Load state system
    - Requires deterministic game logic
    - Recommendation: Avoid using byte[] with BinaryWriter/Reader due to inefficiency

### Additional Systems Needed
- **Spectator System**: Framework prepared with confirm frame input buffer
- **Desync Detection**: Requires custom implementation
- **Demo Recording**: Suggested implementation through confirmed input recording
- **Game Synchronization**: Currently uses first 10 frames for basic synchronization

## Configuration

**Current Unity Configuration Settings**

**Note**: The MaxRollbackFrames setting currently shows 4 frames but effectively provides ~8 frames of rollback in Idol Showdown. This discrepancy is known but functional.

## Installation

```bash
# Using Unity Package Manager (UPM)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.bestogames.isd-rollback": "https://github.com/bryanpaik/isd-rollback.git"
  }
}
```
